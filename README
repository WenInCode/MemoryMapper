list of files:
	-test.c:
		contains the test case source code -- calls memchunk
	-test.h:
		test.c header file
	-memchunk.c:
		contains the source code for scanning the virtual memory space
	-memchunk.h:
		memchunk.c's header file.
	-writeup.txt:
		contains the writeup - description of the chunks with respect to
		different segments (text, data, bss, etc.)

How to compile:
	-Type 'make memchunk.o' into the command line to compile the
		memchunk.o object
	-Type 'make test.o' into the command line to compile the 
		test.o object
	-Type 'make' into the command line to compile whole project

How to run:
	-Type './memchunk -n [arg]' into the command line
		-n [arg] are optional arguments, but must be used together.
		[arg] will not be read without the -n flag
	if -n [arg] is passed it will take on the role of 'size' which is passed
	to memchunk.c's  get_mem_layout(struct memchunk *chunklist, int size);
	However, if no argument is passed in the command line, the program 
	sets 'size' to a default value of 9.

	if [arg] is of invalid type (say a string) size is set to 0.
	getopt handles all invalid flags and missing arguments by default.

Output: 
	Expected output is the formatted list of memory chunks and their
	attributes.
